# testgcba

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

Used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as IDE.

Powered (mildly) by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

I know the "function inside anchors" thing is kinda lame but I thought "what the hell, let the browser handle it. it's a landing page after all..."
